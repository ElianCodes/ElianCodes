# 👋 Hi there!

I'm a Software Engineer based in 🇧🇪 working [@vbridge](<https://www.vbridge.eu>), where I started a couple years ago as an intern. I have a strong focus on design, front-end development and cloud native web-applications with the emphasis on personalisation and technical innovation. Next to pure development, I'm part of a community where I supports many companies in their IT story, and through his work connecting people, via the cloud and in real life.

I'm always available for a chat or drink.

When I'm not behind my computer, I'm behind the turntables trying to give the people an unforgettable night!

## 💼  My Skills

There used to be a cool JSON-like object here of all my skills and tools, which was very attractive and cool, but I found out that my skills constantly improve or change. It’s kind of unmanageable.
