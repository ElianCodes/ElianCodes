## hello there

I'm Elian Van Cutsem, I'm a grad student in Coputer Science with a specialisation in web & mobile. At the moment I'm coding in a lot of different languages and having fun on all kinds of platforms.

On this account you'll find lots of repositories with coding practices or templates for websites. I'm also a heavy linux user, so probably you can find some linux code somewhere.
